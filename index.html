        <h2>Restaurant Plan</h2>
        <p>We are proposing a modern British themed indoor family dining restaurant and bar with additional outside seating. Our contractors will fully renovate the empty space to include new kitchens, appliances, counters, and bar along with new modern furnishings throughout.</p>
        <ul>
                <li>The kitchen and bar counter area will occupy around 650 square feet, leaving ample space inside for comfortable seating.</li>
                <li>The outside area is an absolute must for our concept as it allows our customers a place to sit and relax outside, enjoy shisha or smoke along with their food and beverages.</li>
                <li>We are proposing some sort of fencing or shrubbery for this area. The middle section of the G05 back wall will be removed to incorporate large glass opening doors, creating a really eye-catching front entrance.</li>
                <li>Steel poles will be erected around the outside seating area, similar to the ones at the mall entrance, to ensure complete safety for our customers inside this area at all times.</li>
                <li>We fully understand the landlord will have to lose one parking space to facilitate this outside area, and we are quite happy to negotiate additional rent fees. We also believe it will make a beautiful outdoor feature for the mall, and being in the end position, it will not interfere with any of the landlord's existing clients.</li>
            <li>We include a rough sketch for the proposed layout:</li>

        <h2>Concept & Theme</h2>
        <p>A modern British Retro Style Restaurant diner offering those traditional worldwide recgonized British favourites and more</p>
        <p>Our restaurant will be outfitted to the highest standards with all new furnishings, including tables, chairs, plates, cutlery, cups, saucers, and glasses. We want to "stand out" from the rest.</p>
        <p>Our clientele will come from various parts of Dubai, especially the local community where I have lived for the past 8 years. Many of them have asked when I would bring my UK-themed restaurant here because they know I understand what they and their children want and expect: a high-quality, upmarket restaurant serving delicious food at affordable prices.</p>
        <p>Our concept is to provide this experience with a team of highly qualified staff, including a chef from our UK chain who is known for his high standards and consistent quality. We only source the best produce from top wholesalers and have zero tolerance for tasteless food.</p>

        <h2>Background & Experience</h2>
        <p>I am a British national, 53 years old, and have operated a number of successful businesses in both the UK and UAE. Back in the UK, I believe I was among the first to offer a buffet-style English carvery. I partnered in a restaurant called June's Diner and Bar, established over 25 years ago on the East Coast of Lincolnshire. This concept has since been adapted by many popular chains, especially Irish bars.</p>
        <p>As you will see in the documented pictures in the carvery section, we will be making this one of our big weekend features as it's very popular with all nationalities. I believe ours will be a big winner, especially for the surrounding area, because of the massive selection of over 16 vegetables, all sourced for freshness, flavor, and taste at an affordable price. I was also a partner in Damons restaurant in Sheffield, England. This restaurant became known for its American diner-themed menu and was famous for its Barbecue Ribs, Combo Platters, Finest Seafood, Gourmet Burgers, Fillet steaks, Fish and Chips, the Famous English breakfast, and the Weekend roast carvery buffet.</p>
        <p>I've lived in Dubai Green Community for the past 8 years. Additionally, I hold a Doctor of Finance degree.</p>
